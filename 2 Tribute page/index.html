			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line Jon Bon Jovi's' life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><strong>1980 </strong>Jon recorded his first single,<i> Runaway</i>, at his cousin's studio, with back-up by studio musicians. A local radio station included the song on a compilation tape, and it began to get frequent airplay. The success of Runaway got Jon noticed, and he realized that he'd need more than session players if he wanted to capitalize on his success.</li>
				<li><strong>1984 </strong>The group's self-titled debut came out on January 21, 1984. Filled with their now-signature power ballads underscored by soaring guitar riffs and well-crafted melodies, the album went gold. In April 1985 Bon Jovi released the follow-up album, <i>7800Â° Fahrenheit</i>, which was popular with fans but less so with critics, who were turned off by the hard-rock band's manicured image and formulaic style.</li>
				<li><strong>1989 </strong>After the band went into temporary retirement in 1989, Jon concentrated on his solo career and appeared in his first movie, Young Guns II, for which he won he won a <i>Golden Globe for Best Song, Blaze of Glory</i>.</li>
				<li><strong>1994 </strong>In 1994, the commercial incentive to return to Bon Jovi proved too hard to resist, and the band released another album, <i>Keep The Faith</i>. Jon enjoyed further solo success with <i>1997's Destination Anywhere</i>. The band regrouped two years later to record the Grammy-nominated album, <i>Crush</i>, and again in 2002 for <i>Bounce</i>.</li>
				<li><strong>2017 </strong>In late 2017, marking an impressive journey that produced an estimated 130 million records sold, Bon Jovi was elected to the <i>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</i>.</li>
				<li><strong> 2020 </strong>Not ready to retire their instruments just yet, the band released the single <i>"Unbroken"</i> in November 2019 and followed with <i>"Limitless"</i> in February 2020, ahead of the anticipated release of the album 2020, which came out on October 2, 2020.</li>
